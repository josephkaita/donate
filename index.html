                <i> Revealing war crimes is not a crime. </i>
            </h1>
            <h3> WikiLeaks editor and publisher Julian Assange is facing a 175 year
                sentence for publishing truthful information in the public interest. </h3>

            <p>
                Julian Assange is being sought by the current US administration for
                publishing US government documents which exposed war crimes and human
                rights abuses. The politically motivated charges represent an unprecedented
                attack on press freedom and the public’s right to know – seeking to
                criminalise basic journalistic activity.
            </p>

            <p>
                If convicted Julian Assange faces a sentence of 175 years, likely to
                be spent in isolation which would drive him to commit suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
                UK District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled it would be oppressive
                to extradite him to the United States of America and refused to
                extradite him, yet the case eventually moved to the UK Supreme
                Court where it overruled the decision and Assange’s extradition
                request moved forward to the UK Home Sectretary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assange’s legal team are fighting the extradition and have now
                filed an appeal to the High Court. The High Court now must approve
                the grounds of the appeal.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the UK extradites Assange it would violate Article 4 of the
                US-UK extradition treaty which bars extradition for political offences.
            </p>
            <h3>Extraditing Julian Assange to the United States would kill him.</h3>
